# Sorting Algorithms

This collection features a variety of sorting algorithms implemented in C, designed for clarity and efficiency.

## Included Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
  - Quick Sort (Hoare partition)
- Shell Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Counting Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bitonic Sort
- Deck Sort (a specialized algorithm for sorting deck cards)

## Structure

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own file, ensuring clear and maintainable code.

Test files are also included to validate the functionality and performance of each algorithm.

## Usage

These implementations can be used as a reference or a starting point for projects requiring efficient data sorting in C.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/uosyph/sorting_algorithms.git
cd sorting_algorithms
```

2. Compile any sorting algorithm:

```sh
gcc -o sort_algorithm sort_algorithm.c
```

3. Run the compiled program:

```sh
./sort_algorithm
```
