# Sorting Algorithms

his repository contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in C. The repository includes popular sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort (including Hoare partition implementation), shell sort, cocktail sort, counting sort, merge sort, heap sort, radix sort, bitonic sort, and a sorting algorithm specifically designed to sort deck cards.

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate file with a clear and concise code structure. The repository also includes test files to validate the functionality of each sorting algorithm.

These algorithms can be used as a reference or a starting point for any project that requires sorting of data in C.
